  Today you got another gift, a gift called present, today you have another
  opportunity to tell and show those around you how much you love and care about then,
  but true love is measure with actions not only with words.
  We need to give more love, because the way you live your life is not going
  to affect only you but everyone arounds, we need to love without fear love without
  reason because if you love only those who love you what difference are you making. Love more, fear less.

  “And if I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries and all
  knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.”

  — Diego Oliveira
